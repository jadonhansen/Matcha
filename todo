Gabriel:

    NEW: (19 April 2020)
        - notification of being liked is showing my own email. Whereas it should be the person who liked my email address
        - change emails appearing in notifications to be usernames (not sure if this is a frontend fix..?)
        - profile page: the liked array is not being generated. So the button remains as 'like' and doesn't change to 'unlike'
        - send me 'advanced_matches' named variable when a filter/advanced search is made on Match Me! page
        - try delete the uploaded files/images from the upload folder once they are loaded onto the DB

    SEARCH PAGE:
        - ordering

    NOTIFICATION PAGE:
        - make notifications appear live
            - is an ajax fix, if jquery works for the chat then we can just do that for this too client side

    EXTRA:
        - handle errors (error message appears)
        - make fields secure
        - update location to work with postal codes or something like that
        - might need to change login from email to username

Jadon:
    - sort out create account screen resizing
    - test alles
    - oops page
